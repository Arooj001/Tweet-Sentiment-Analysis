# Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis

üìä Excited to share my recent assignment on Tweet Sentiment Analysis! üê¶üí¨

I've been exploring the fascinating field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), and I wanted to apply my skills to a practical problem. For this assignment, I focused on analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets using Python.

To kickstart the project, I imported essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and NLTK, which provided me with powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and natural language processing. I also sourced a dataset specifically curated for tweet sentiment analysis, allowing me to train and evaluate my models effectively.

One of the initial steps I took was renaming features to make them more intuitive and easier to work with. This small adjustment streamlined the subsequent data preprocessing and analysis tasks, enhancing the overall clarity and understandability of the code.

In order to gain insights into the dataset, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA). This involved visualizing and summarizing the data to identify patterns, trends, and potential challenges. EDA allowed me to understand the distribution of sentiments in the tweet dataset and gather valuable insights for the subsequent stages of my analysis.

To get a better understanding of the text data, I counted the words in the tweets. This helped me gain insights into the most frequent words used in different sentiment categories, providing a glimpse into the language and topics associated with positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Additionally, I plotted sentiment words to visualize the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral words in the tweet dataset. This analysis allowed me to identify the most commonly used sentiment words, providing further context for the sentiment analysis task.

Preprocessing the text data was a crucial step in my assignment. I applied techniques such as lowercasing, removing punctuation and stop words, and tokenization to prepare the tweets for sentiment analysis. These preprocessing steps helped in reducing noise and improving the accuracy of subsequent models.
